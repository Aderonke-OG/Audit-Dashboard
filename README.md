# 🧾 Audit Findings Dashboard (2022)

## 📊 Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard was designed to make sense of **audit findings across different business processes, branches, and risk categories** for the 2022 fiscal year.  
The goal was simple: to move beyond static reports and give audit and management teams a clear, interactive way to track trends, identify high-risk areas, and measure how effectively issues were being resolved.

The data came from internal audit logs that included records of findings, their significance, responsible branches, and the level of redressal achieved.

## 🧠 The Challenge
Many organizations deal with recurring audit issues because their data is scattered or hard to interpret.  
This project aimed to bring everything together into a **central, data-driven view** that helps answer key questions like:

- Which branches or processes are generating the most audit findings?  
- How severe are these issues, and are they being resolved on time?  
- What trends can we see over the course of the year?  
- How can we use this data to make smarter compliance decisions?  

---

## ⚙️ Tools and Approach
- **Power BI** for data modeling, DAX measures, and dashboard design  
- **Excel/CSV** for the raw audit data source  
- **Power Query** for data cleaning and transformation  

The dashboard was built with a focus on clarity, interactivity, and storytelling — allowing users to drill down into specific processes, branches, and risk levels.

## 📈 Key Features
- **Instances by Risk Rating:** Shows how the number of audit issues compares across different risk categories.  
- **Instances by Business Process:** Identifies which operations (e.g., Branch Operations, Food Processing) need the most attention.  
- **Branch Comparison:** Highlights how findings differ across locations to uncover regional trends.  
- **Monthly Trends:** Displays how audit instances evolve throughout the year.  
- **Results and Actions:** Breaks down outcomes (Satisfied, Needs Improvement, Unsatisfactory) and actions taken (Warnings, Fines, None).  
- **Redressal Gauge:** Tracks how effectively issues were addressed, with an average resolution rate of **61.26%**.  

---

## 💡 Insights and Impact
- **Branch Operations** and **Food Processing** emerged as top areas for audit issues, revealing need for stronger internal controls in this area.  
- **Moderate-risk findings** were the most common, highlighting the need for proactive mitigation before they escalate.  
- **West and East branches** showed higher volumes of findings — aligned with operational size but signaling areas for process optimization.  
- An **average redressal rate of 61%** indicates steady progress but also room for improvement.  
- By visualizing trends and performance, this dashboard helped teams **cut unresolved findings by over 30% compared to the previous year.**

---

## 🧩 Outcome
This project turned routine audit reports into a **storytelling tool for data-driven decision-making**.  
Instead of sifting through spreadsheets, management can now explore trends, spot red flags, and act faster — improving transparency and accountability across the organization.

## 🔗 What’s Next
- It can be connected to live audit tracking systems for real-time updates
